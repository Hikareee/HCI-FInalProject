# About Us + App description:
We are first year university students who have a hard time focusing and enjoys procrastination at it's finest. We believe that many of us are struggling through the same problems and thus, we decided to create an online application programmed to help users improve their ability to concentrate through the unique features we provide!

# Features:
- Competitively trains users' focus through a variety of fun brain games
- Provides daily missions for users to complete with the aim of helping users form healthy day-to-day habits. Users can select from which categories they want to get their missions from.
- Users earn points from playing and completing daily missions. These points are called "Focal Points" and can be accumulated and exchanged for a wide variety of online gift cards.
- Users can track, view and compare their progress & results with friends nearby.

# Target Users:
- Users with ADHD
- Chronic Multitaskers
- Procrasinators
- Users with short attention span
